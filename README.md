# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

# How to generate markdown from template

Install solidity doc gen
`npm install solidity-docgen`

Get the correct compiler version
`npm install -D solc-0.7@npm:solc@0.7.6`

Put the updated template `contract.hbs` in a /templates folder under the same directory as /contracts that you want to generate

Run `npx solidity-docgen --solc-module solc-0.7 -t ./templates`

# How to add a new page

Create a markdown file in its respective version directory within the main /docs/ folder

Add the new file to its respective sidebar file i.e., 'V2sidebars.js' or 'V3sidebars.js'
